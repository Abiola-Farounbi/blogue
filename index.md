**Welcome to my page!** \\
Hi, my name is Ifihanagbara Olusheye, known as _Ifihan_. I'm married to Levi Ackerman.

Currently studing Systems Engineering, I'm a broke student and I currently run on pure vibes :)

I also code and write atimes (when I'm bored). Check me out on [GitHub](https://github.com/Ifihan), [Dev.to](https://dev.to/ifihan), and [Hashnode](https://hashnode.com/@Ifihan).
