**Welcome to my page!** \\\\
Hi, my name is Ifihanagbara Olusheye, known as Ifihan. I'm married to Levi Ackerman.

Currently studing Systems Engineering, I'm a broke student and I currently run on pure vibes :)

When I'm bored, I write on [Dev.to](https://dev.to/ifihan), and [Hashnode](https://hashnode.com/@Ifihan). I also code and push some [GitHub](https://github.com/Ifihan).
